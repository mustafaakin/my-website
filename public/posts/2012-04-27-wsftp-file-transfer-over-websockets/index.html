  <h1>WSTP - File Transver Over Websockets</h1>
  <time datetime=2012-04-27T23:31:51Z class="post-date">Fri, Apr 27, 2012</time>
  <p>If you were following my blog, you may seem that I have once tried to make WS-FTP project with Java, however the web-sockets were on draft and it was changing quickly and they were not safe. Meantime, I have learned and mastered NodeJS and met Socket.io, and I decided to use them, since they were providing a better interface and it was much more easier to code a web server with NodeJS rather than Java.</p>
<p>The project I have made is very simple and not optimized. I quickly wanted to demonstrate the concept and will try to explain the workflow now:</p>
<ol>
<li>NodeJS server is listening on port 3000. It both provides socket.io interface and a web-interface for administration (not implemented yet, but that&rsquo;s the idea)</li>
<li>Chrome Extension (Client) requests unlimited stroage and ability to connect any site, so connection can be established.</li>
<li>Client connects to the server. Asks for any arbitrary folder contents, with filenames and size.</li>
<li>Client wants to download a file asks for block 0 of file. And depending on size, it adds N requests to the work queue.</li>
<li>Server just opens the file, reads the requested block. In my app, block sizes are 8 KBs.</li>
<li>Whenever a block is gathered on client, it constructs a BLOB object and saves it in memory.</li>
<li>After consturction of BLOB, client pops 2 tasks from queue and wants them.</li>
<li>This processes continues until all the blocks are fetched. Client saves the data to Chrome&rsquo;s sandboxed filesystem, in which user can download the file to local filesystem.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you  can see, it is very primitive, only 1 connection and 1 transfer at a time, and if you install it it will not have a very nice GUI, however, it will certainly be a starting point. Currently there are some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s single threaded and upon recieving a packet from a socket, Chrome can hang depending on file size.</li>
<li>Only 1 connection, 1 transfer at a time.</li>
<li>No nice GUI, but it will about to come!</li>
<li>File saving, handling in memory is not efficient with this way, needs a better algorithm, some temproary disk access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, as you can imagine, this can be asily turned into a P2P system. Bascially, we download blocks and there is no reason to not downlaod blocks from multiple clients. I have made this project available on GitHub, so anyone can easily access it and freely use it and maybe extend it!</p>
